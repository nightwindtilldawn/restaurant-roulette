# restaurant-roulette
App asks users to enter basic criteria of what they are looking for (cuisine, location/distance, etc).  Will populate a “spin the wheel” button that picks a random result and then links map/delivery links.  API’s that we used: zippopotamus, zomato, google maps…

## User Story

I want to eat something
But I am indecisive
So I want the restaurant roulette app to decide for me


## Acceptance Criteria


GIVEN a Food dashboard 
WHEN I enter a zipcode and select "Let's Eat!" button
